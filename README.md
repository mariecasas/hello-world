Hello World! Welcome to my GitHub.  

Let me tell you about last Friday. 
I went to a picnic up north. Great weather! Even better company along with good food. Lots of kids were frolicking around the bright green fields. Toddlers played with the water table and temporary tattoos. A couple of clowns did some face-painting. Our friendly firemen also came by with their huge fire engine for some show and tell.
